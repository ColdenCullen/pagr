pagr
====

A paginating CSS/JavaScript library for creating smoothly scrolling pages.

### Format
Using pagr is incredibly simple; simply create a div (or section or what have you), give it the class `pagecontainer-horiz` or `pagecontainer-vert`, and then add the class `page` to its direct children.

### To Initialize
In your HTML page, include the css and js files. Then, in your onload function, call pagr( [config] ). Config can have any of the following values:
```
{
    initialPage: "/home", // [no default] Page to scroll to as soon as the page loads
    scrollTime: 0,        // [default: 400] Time in milliseconds it takes to scroll
    scrollEase: "",       // [default: easeOutQuad] Any easing listed on http://api.jqueryui.com/easings/
    linkName: "pagrlink"  // [default: pagrlink] The class name to look for links with
}
```

### Examples
Want to see pagr in action? Take a trip over to [node.coldencullen.com](http://node.coldencullen.com/) (which is SUPER in development) and check it out. The main page uses the horizontal pagination, and the projects section uses a vertical one.
