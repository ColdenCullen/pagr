pagr
====

A paginating css/javascript library for creating smoothly scrolling pages.

### Format
Using pagr is incredibly simple; simple create a div (or section or what have you), give it the class `pagecontainer-horiz` or `pagecontainer-vert`, and then add the class `page` to it's direct children.

### To Initialize
In your HTML page, include the css and js files. Then, in your onload function, call pagr(). It's that simple!

### Examples
Want to see pagr in action? Take a trip over to [node.coldencullen.com](http://node.coldencullen.com/) (which is SUPER in development) and check it out. The main page uses the horizontal pagination, and the projects section uses a vertical one.
